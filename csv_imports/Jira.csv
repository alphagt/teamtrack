**  Work done to refine project poster
**  Created a Genius mirror customer interview script and had meeting with Apple and Netflix, more meeting are being lined up
** Communicated a a set of low resolution high level design options with wider team, got good feedback and ideas/suggestions.
** Gave wider team some training on the history of mirrors and how they currently work. 
** Captured user stories and agreed on priority, user stories have been grouped into one of three buckets _shipping_, _stretch_ and _not shipping_
** Productive meeting with design team and they have started to think about the IX of the solution, we all seem to be on the same page and there is a shared understanding about the problem we are trying to solve and the direction of the solution. 
** Agreed engagement model with support
* Goals
** I am at AWS for most of next week so not a lot of progress to be expected
** Document solution space in a more formal way and start building consensus for an approach

issues regarding full bucket scan. We did not have a chance to run scan
across all the files in downloads as we are hitting 17% error rate and for
some files we didn't manage to scan them at all. We believe it is
unacceptable and raised the issue with them. We did quick look to see if
there are alternatives on the market but found none (apart of free
solutions like clam av which is not what our legal department would like to
see). As we do not want to be blocked by this we are now switching our
priority to work on DR for downloads. Expect blog post about that at the
beginning of the week.

So we can help work out what the next steps are (if any), can you please explain in more detail how this project affects customers' ability to migrate between Server and cloud (in either direction)? Some questions to think about:

How reversible is this?

Which customer segments will be affected and how many?

Is there a workaround?

Thanks,

However, we do have a strong obligation towards both our customers and our business. 

The cost of delay for some of the items in Phase 2 is high because our customers care deeply about their ability to meet the legal requirements; there are heavy financial implications for our customers if they are found to be non-compliant. We need to make sure that our customers are capable of using our products without facing these risks, otherwise the flow on effect would be implications upon our Atlassian business. 

The business implications of not actioning Phase 2 are as below:

Risk of churn due to customers' uncertainty or inability to remain GDPR compliant whilst using our product 
Risk of reduction in adoption rates due to risk of GDPR non-compliance 
Legal risks - customer may get sued for non-compliance and hold us accountable 
Business reputation may be impacted dependent on how we choose to support our customers in meeting their compliance efforts

Next week we will continue with the gap analysis and start assembling a shortlist of doc changes, based on what we know so far. ","07/Jun/18 6:46 PM PDT;mziemba;8 June. This week:
 * We started [an audit of channels|https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/SIX/Identifying+DC+doc+channels] through which we communicate Data Center information to the customers.
 * We sorted [DC docs feedback items|https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/SIX/Gap+analysis+-+stakeholder+interviews+-+raw] that we gathered from different stakeholders over time.
 * We've begun exploring the first two 'hunches' to come out of the gap analysis - system requirements and Server v Data Center feature comparison. We'll be collecting info from products over the next couple of weeks, then determining the best way to communicate this info in the docs.

Next week:
 * Short week this week for Queen's birthday public holiday.
 * DC product writers will start collecting info on system requirements, and Server v Data Center feature comparison docs.","14/Jun/18 7:44 PM PDT;mziemba;*15 June. This week:*
 * We continued working on [the audit of channels|https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/SIX/Identifying+DC+doc+channels] and research hunches.
 * We checked what's possible in terms of documentation research (in general and during Summit in September) and made sure that the research team is aware of our strategy and needs.
 * We aligned with Marketing Program Management.

*Note:*
 * It was a short week (Queens birthday public holiday)
 * The yearly check-ins process has started this week and will finish on Tuesday next week, which has had an impact on our capacity.","21/Jun/18 9:16 PM PDT;rrobins;22 June. This week we:
 * Shared our FY19 plan with stakehodlers
 * Shared our plan with Cameron, and got some good feedback
 * Worked with customer-facing teams to find out what documentation they write themselves, what types of docs they use, and how they share them
 * As part of our gap analysis work, we've started tackling the first two gaps. Product writers have gathered information for these, and a proof of concept 'feature comparison' page is done, and ready to discuss. Proof of concept requirements page is in progress.

We'll continue to update these as we add more DC-only features over time.  
 * We expect the Bitbucket and Crowd feature comparison pages to be ready to publish within the next two weeks. #sweatthedetails
 * User testing of the feature comparison page layout provided some interesting additional insights about Data Center generally. You can read all about it at [Feature comparison user testing|http://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SIX/pages/127712754/Feature+comparison+user+testing]

As Michalina is on holidays, and Rachel is preparing for the 6.11 Confluence release on Tuesday, and helping out with the docs for our recent AWS CloudFormation template changes, so there hasn't been any new work this week.

* Several Project Mesa workshops (CAC replacement) were held over the past two weeks. We had excellent representation from most of our Sydney based Data Center / Server writers.

* The most significant category of problem when using Atlaskit or React with AUI is to do with layers.

This will have a short-term and long tail effect:

* UI bugs to do with clipping or otherwise obscured layers will be reduced, thus improving the usability of our apps.
* By solving our layering issues, we can relieve the largest amount of developer pain and remove the largest number of workarounds for behaviours from plugins. This will, in turn, reduce the amount of code needed to power the UI, thus improving performance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49:38.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"11/Dec/18 6:49 PM PST;pscobie;Think this should be 'in progress', let me know if it would benefit from a cross team kick off (given the label!)","14/Dec/18 6:11 AM PST;mszpyra;7.12 status

h3. General
At Risk due to several releases happening at the same time, Now that we release in lockstep with software and service desk the risk of having to pull a release has increased 3 times. 

We have not still been able to schedule work on the release pipeline such that we can automate the lockstep release process above.

h3. JIRA 7.1.0

BP builds have not been fixed still. There is progress but it's not as quick as we would expect.

Soke performance has not been tracked between master and bugfix for the whole 7.1.0 cycle, there is a big risk that once Gdansk fixes this we will uncover a nasty performance issue that makes us slip.

There is a mysterious issue with portal page search returning incorrect results of EACj-staging that the SD team has not been able to clear up yet. This has blocked the upgrade of EACj prod to 7.1.0 / 3.1.0

* 7.1.5 was cancelled due to a bug in MySQL and Oracle
* 7.1.6 released by Oswaldo and the R&R team in Gdansk
* 7.1.7 being released now

+7.1.7 is late+
Because of infrastructure problems, 7.1.7 is still in the pipes, being finished this evening and tomorrow morning. Maven infrastructure failed randomly for us.

+Next Milestones+
Release 7.2.0

+Risks / Dependencies+
* New pipeline may contain some errors and slow us down in the beginning, which means the first release it is used.
* Found a new way to bork a release: deployment to maven went only half way through which locked the process and required manual intervention by buildeng.

7.2.4 was built.

I'm now setting the status to *AT RISK*

 

Reasoning

Our regular pipelines of deploying bugfix releases to EAC/J and EAC/J Staging are now blocked, because the EAC/J Staging Run out of space. Fixing this is tracked as PENG-6023 .

(on) Resolving PENG-6023 will immediately unblock our normal bugfix release process.

 

 

Lukasz has assessed the way to upgrade JAC Staging and JAC with the bugfix release (to get some dogfood). Unfortunately this is also blocked because due to misconfiguration plug-ins are not properly upgraded on JAC Staging. Fixing this is tracked as PENG-5375.
(!) We do have < 2 weeks time to use JAC Staging/JAC since later we are planning to install 7.3 EAP#1 there, which will make impossible to install previous bugfix releases on the instances.

 

 ","28/Oct/16 12:19 PM PDT;ialexeyenko;I'm changing {color:#f6c342}*AT RISK*{color} to {color:#14892c}*ON TRACK.*{color}

h3. JIRA 7.2.4

7.2.4 that was built 21 Oct now running at EACJ. We plan to release public (DAC) mid next week.

(!) due to Ignat's error, JSD has not really got any changes (except the version bump) in this release. I've confirmed with JSD it's ok to have their changes moved to the 7.2.5 release.

 ","12/May/17 10:04 AM PDT;ialexeyenko;Because of the recent HOT issues that we had after deploying a new version to EACJ we have decided to adjust our deployment process. We need more cover and support from the WST team in case of such events.

We are definign an upgrade process with Workplace Technology team - as they are our key partner in upgrading internal production instance, aka EACJ. Our main contact in Workplace Technology is [~rchippendale].

We are plainnig to cut off 7.3.7 and deploy it to EACJ on the week of the 22nd of May. The date is not affected yet but the lack of a new deployment process, and we are planning to have the new process in place by then.

[~packermann] is owning this from JIRA side, with [~ialexeyenko] assisting.

We are counting on the sense of urgency on the WST side. However, we know that it takes time for two teams in different geo locations to setup a new deployment process, that's why we are signalising that until we agree on the new process and get a sign-off from [~mhenderson] - we won't be able to proceed we releasing 7.3.7 and we will have to push the release date. We still believe that we can make it, but we are running out of time quickly.
h3. 7.3.7
 * Cut on 17 May 2017
 * Planned release on around ~31 May 2017 (to be updated as we established the new process).

In cooperation with WPT team we prepared and described a new EAC/J deployment process. Raid team will be still responsible for EAC/J but it will receive coverage from WPT. Deploy time will be stated together. These two teams together will be able to react better then before on possible service degradations.

We also prepared a procedure when EAC/J incident occurs outside deploy hours.

We hope this will allow us to unblock EAC/J deployments in the next week.

Release manager or the Raid team don't usually decide on the scope of the premier / backport bugfix releases - we rather do operational part of shipping bits so customers can download them.

Having said that - we can only tell the planned dates for the releases, which can be tracked at:
 * [JIRA Release Dashboard|https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/JIRASERVER/JIRA+Release+Dashboard] - for release versions, status and dates (mid-term).
 * Current issue to see weekly status and short-term plans.

As for the scope - [~jkurcek] and the Pirates figure out which issues needs to be back-ported and which JIRA versions needs to be shipped. Then they'd just are issuing a release from a current release manager.","16/Nov/17 7:23 AM PST;packermann;h1. 7.5.3

The reason for this is, the plan was to ensure all API breaking changes (anything that could break plugin compatibility such as removal of deprecated things) were merged by 21-Dec-2018. This milestone was not met until 9-Jan-2019. As a result three milestones that depended on this event slip:
* Deploy to stash-dev
* Deploy to stash.a.c
* Release of EAP

The above mentioned deployments, and associated dogfooding, are a critical part of QA. And the EAP really needs to be released on a date such that plugin vendors have 2+ weeks to update their plugins.

*Risks*
- By far the biggest risk is us identifying new bugs (during dogfooding or other testing) that are determined to be blockers. The best way we can mitigate the risk is to ensure these QA activities happen as early as possible.
- We are dependant on the Marketplace team to release a final version of UPM 4.0, but we have no control over their priorities. One way we could mitigate this would be to determine if we can ship with a milestone build.",13/Jan/19 6:39 PM PST;mellis2;Do we know if Marketplace have any date locked in for the release of UPM 4.0?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Related issue - JIRA Server encountered this issue last week with the detail written up on [https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/TRANS-2492]. Paweł was able to update the code and get things back in sync but not without first having to troubleshoot and waste significant time. Other products now aware that if they haven’t already done so they need to update the product strings in product source code so the updated capitalisation for English i18n strings is in sync between the source code and TAC.","23/Oct/17 4:39 PM PDT;pscobie;[~iwade] thanks for the prompt, updated report (yes!)","02/Nov/17 7:57 PM PDT;pscobie;*Updates this week in {color:#205081}blue{color}*

","02/Sep/18 5:48 PM PDT;alyakovlev;[~pscobie] Confluence is done their part. Upgraded to UPM 2.22.14 and changed in-product text from Add-ons to Apps. One question for you. Rachel encountered an issue where she had the en_us language pack instead of Confluence’s default en_uk, and the US one didn’t have the translations, of course, because we haven’t done a translation run. I’m wondering if the translations will be explicitly handled and tested. I suppose the US ones will just get straight-forward translated from UK. What about other languages? Is there a specific word we’re using in other languages?","02/Sep/18 6:16 PM PDT;pscobie;THanks [~alyakovlev],

cc [~rrobins]","02/Sep/18 6:47 PM PDT;rrobins;Seems quite important to add to the glossary, in case there are significant differences in some languages as to how you'd translate something like a mobile app, and these apps which are more like extensions (or dare I say it, add-ons). 

Also is Marketplace's UI translated (or any of our marketing around these)?  If it is, we should use exactly the same terminology in each language.

I've made sure the changes work for products that haven't yet changed over, as well as the ones that have (Confluence yay!).   I've also updated all the screenshots and fixed some things, as those docs were several years out of date in places. 

From a Confluence POV, we decided to go with *""Manage apps"" *as the dropdown item (which matches what UPM calls it in the Admin console).  I'd recommend all other products stick to the same naming, as Apps on it's own didn't provide enough context for a user.

CLOONEY-1 - upgrade month has pivoted to upgrade slots - where customers would be incentivised to upgrade within agreed months. Further thinking required.
CLOONEY-2 - Release notes for Confluence ER look awesome with visual bug graphs. Plan to roll out for Jira.
CLOONEY-3 - Targeted Marketing campaign about the stability of latest ER Campaigns is Blocked due to COPS capacity, will definitely consider it for the future now that we have DC Marketing Manager onboard 
CLOONEY-4 - Atlassian Champion training - with DC Deployments team to confirm if they are keen to take part
CLOONEY-5 - Identify Upgrade owners 'the champion has left' - identify new champions - With customer success to review [~jridge]
CLOOENY 6 - PS upgrade partners for all upgrades within the next 6 months. Question with [~dchevell]
CLOONEY 7 - Update GSAC to auto-flag any tickets from large clients so we can better encourage them to upgrade with [~srenfrow] to respond
CLOONEY 8 - Pay partner to help customer upgrade (help with upgrade tasks, app compatibility, etc.) - Question on approach with [~aserna]
CLOONEY-9 - Provide performance statistics on improvements in ER to help drive upgrades Boards are 6x faster!! (i.e. Jakub's Coffee/Jira 8.0 Blog Post) - Jira -  if there are any noteworthy stories of performance gains across ERs, Content Design will be on top of them via the usual channels, and we'd be sure to put them on the ER release notes. At the moment, there just aren't any that we can see. Confluence - TBC.
CLOONEY-10 - A crack team of engineers to go hand to hand with customers on site to aid upgrade process/training - will help our internal empathy and customer upgrade rate [~tdavenport] reviewing with team.
CLOONEY-11 - Develop an in product upgrade report that tells customers what steps they need to take to upgrade successfully - in progress via PC-7055 
CLOONEY - 13 Add an icon for ERs on CAC & download page - investigatory work in backlog. Asked [~kkolonko] if he can review with PM to prioritise it.
CLOONEY-14 - Go hand to hand with the 24 of 103 largest DC customers that don't have TAMS/PS - we have the customer contacts - with [~cdeatsch] to suggest next steps given it was his idea :)

Locked in our success metric for project - 100% of customers in the large cohort currently raising L1/L2 issues upgrade to an ER by the end of FY19.  (currently we are at 50%).

The nature of each loop is that it gives us a different lens on the needs of our customers. Each loop has more or less value to us than another, based on how applicable it is to our mission.

As part of our mission to elevate DC into a rock solid enterprise-grade solution, we want to be sure that we are getting info from the most helpful information loops. And for the enterprise market, these loops are generally the ones that are more human-scale, such as feedback from our TAMs and our EAs.

# The Confluence database for a given customer is expected to grow at a rate of 5x or more due to the volume of synchrony data. This will be unacceptable to customers over a period of time as their database will become unmanageable. There are currently manual steps available from support that result in a lot of admin work and possible data loss.

We're going to be doing two spikes to understand the path forward:

*Spike # 1:* Delete data (permanently) older than a certain publish point.

*Spike # 2:* Evict data from synchrony tables and insert in a different table after compression.

*This week:*

We've started on spike # 1. We'll be working with the synchrony team to assess and implement some of the ideas.

*Next milestones:*

Complete spike # 1 and based on it's results decide whether we'd like to start implementing it full-on or invest time into spike # 2.","13/Jul/17 6:09 PM PDT;ukhalid;*This week:*

We have been trying to do spike # 1 but it's been tough primarily because there's a certain ramp up in understanding synchrony code and learning some advanced clojure. Also, since it's the start of the FY so the developer has been supporting some other project/investigations/support cases, so progress on this project has been slow. I've updated the ship date to reflect a new more meaningful target.

*Next week:*

Keep making progress on the spike and try to understand if it's actually possible to go thru with this option or if there's merit in doing spike # 2.",20/Jul/17 6:03 PM PDT;ukhalid;No updates this week due to innovation week.,"27/Jul/17 6:06 PM PDT;ukhalid;We've decided to pause this project for now. Following are some reasons that led to this decision:
 # Other higher priority stuff in the pipeline.
 # We did a spike to understand the technical challenges and effort involved. We now understand it to be a fair amount of work (aka time sink) and we currently do not have any compelling reasons (support cases, enterprise blockers etc) to push this ahead of other stuff on the roadmap.
 # Based on our discussion with the synchrony team, it seems that this project is already on their radar. They haven't road-mapped it yet but there's a good chance that they will do that soon (since their current implementation of s3 eviction doesn't seem to be as helpful). Also, in parallel we're working on [upgrading confluence server to use synchrony's master branch|https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/CONFSRVDEV-1854] which will be helpful in seamlessly adopting this feature once it's available.","05/Apr/18 9:55 PM PDT;ukhalid;We have decided to resume this project, primarily because we have a Clojure team member in Confluence (from the Synchrony team) which means we will have first hand insights into what changes we can make. Also we have forked off Synchrony code bases, and since Server has its own repo, we have much more liberty to make Server-specific changes.

We also had a pre-kickoff meeting in which we discussed possible ways to evict synchrony data. There are a couple of spikes we need to do to assess whether we have a viable solution. We will start with the first (and more important) spike within synchrony code next week.","27/Apr/18 12:05 AM PDT;ukhalid;*This week*

We've completed the spike and created a page with all relevant details on how to move forward.

*Next milestones*

All stake holders of this project will review and decide if the proposed solution makes sense. If it does, we'll start implementing.

 *Risks & Mitigation*

We have some competing priorities (L1/L2 related tickets to Synchrony) due to which this project might be paused intermittently. If we decide to pursue the L1/L2 tickets I will pause this project or push out the date accordingly.","03/May/18 9:27 PM PDT;ukhalid;*This week*

While we get buy-in from all stake holders on the best course of action to proceed with from amongst the options listed [here|https://bulldogwiki.internal.atlassian.com/wiki/display/CSE/Synchrony+Data+Eviction], we have started implementing one of the options (option-A) since it is fairly independent and low-effort/low-risk.

*Next milestones*
 * Complete work on option-A and figure out dogfooding strategy.
 * Finalize decision on other options and start implementing the approach to eviction.

*Risks & Mitigation*

We have only 1 Clojure/Synchrony resource on the team & we're also trying to use their time for reviewing & breaking down L1/L2 issues related to Synchrony. So it will effect the progress on this project.

 ",06/May/18 9:24 PM PDT;pscobie;Hi [~abarnes] will we have a GSM for this feature or are the success metrics in the PC ticket suffice? ,"13/May/18 6:44 PM PDT;ukhalid;*This week*

Finished working on the storage layer related changes to Synchrony related to implementing option-A. What's left is to expose that functionality using the REST API. However there are a couple ways to do it, 1) Remove it directly from the requesting node, 2) Remove it from the node that is responsible for the entity being removed. Problem with # 1 is that some in-memory data might remain even after deletion. Problem # 2 is that even though its more thorough, the part of code where it resides is complex and not well written, so would need more effort and time to implement correctly. We will need to decide which one suits us better given effort estimates & relative priorities of other work.

*Next milestones*

Finalize storage layer work and then write a script to trigger deletion manually and see how much gains we get on instances the size of bulldog & EAC.

*Risks & Mitigation*

We will pause work on this project soon because we need to work on a project related to changes in Synchrony based on L1/L2 tickets.",14/May/18 12:02 AM PDT;pscobie;Pausing work soon - [~ukhalid] does that mean the ship date should be pushed out and that [~abarnes] has more time to do the GSM?,"17/May/18 8:14 PM PDT;ukhalid;*This week*

We completed work on Synchrony side of things for option-A. Changes on Confluence side have not been started yet. We also ran some queries to gauge how much storage we can save from it. On a small db like bulldog, its ~5%. However we haven't been able to run it on an EAC snapshot to see benefits from a large db (mainly due to query lag).

*Next milestones*

We are pausing this project for now to start work on L1/L2 Synchrony related changes. We might pick it up again once we're done with other higher priority work. I've pushed out the target date.

**None","03/Oct/18 3:21 AM PDT;bmcnamara;*This week*
After a pause on this project while the team focused on delivering managed nodes for Synchrony this project has been reprioritised and we are back to envisioning.

This project now has GDPR requirements as a driver in addition to the original requirements around Synchrony scaling issues.  

The team is currently focused on agreeing on a solution on this decision page https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVER/pages/313934945/GDPR+Phase+2+Server+Synchrony+Decision.  Once a solution is agreed we expect to start implementation in the next week or so.","03/Oct/18 3:24 AM PDT;ukhalid;Quick update: We're resuming this project in an effort to resolve the Synchrony storage problem but also because we're compelled to do it due to GDPR.
So far we have a open decision page where the team is discussing possible solutions and estimates. Once we've identified the right solution, we'll assess whether we can use it for both Storage & GDPR dimensions of this problem. If not, we'll separate the other into its own PC ticket. But our hope is to go with a solution that can help us address both problems simultaneously.","06/Oct/18 3:54 AM PDT;dwillis;h1. This week

* Reopened this PC, which has been repurposed to solve synchrony GDPR Right To Be Forgotten requests as well as _improving_ the storage situation.  A subsequent project will likely be required to make synchrony storage less problematic still.
* Finished initial decision of what we want to achieve for the sake of Synchrony RTBF requests in the short-medium term. (e.g. 6.14)

The existing manual solution is terrible but effective.  So we will iteratively improve it.  
# First automating it so it can be performed from the UI.
# Then improving that feature to reduce data loss and end-user experience issues
","14/Oct/18 2:45 AM PDT;dwillis;h1. This week

* [https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/PSR-166] was brought to our attention, and we spent some time exploring what can be done for this customer without a release.  The attention on this customer shows that the good-enough solution we are proposing for GDPR _may not_ be our highest priority.  We will most likely begin a plug-in to ship to that customer next week.  That plugin should act as something of a prototype for a storage reduction solution, but _perhaps_ not as a GDPR solution.

It's worth highlighting that the customer's concern is less with the manual work required by an admin team, and more with the risk of data loss for their users. This suggests that a simple automation of the existing process is something we may not want to advertise to customers, and we should consider keeping the feature dark till the data loss is fixed.","21/Oct/18 3:21 AM PDT;dwillis;h1. This week

* We continued work on [https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/PSR-166]. After spending some time brainstorming ways to write a plugin to drop some data for the customer, we think we've found a way to reduce unnecessary data with a SQL query that removes the records for fully-published changes. We've rigourously attacked this plan and I'm moderately confident we can deliver the customer something useful by mid-week.
* This exercise has also dramatically improved the team's (ok, my) understanding of what data we store in Confluence about synchrony events and when. This puts us in a better situation for our eventual shipped feature.","04/Nov/18 3:44 AM PST;dwillis;h1. This fortnight

* We delivered a solution we thought would help the primary customer on [https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/PSR-166] a week ago (but missed the PC update). 
* We spent some time this week working on implementing the synchrony methods needed to delete synchrony events from the synchrony tables.
* After experiencing the benefits of querying the confluence and synchrony tables together, there is a temptation to improve the efficiency of the product implementation by Synchrony or Confluence ""cheating"" in some sense by looking at the others' tables, and also still obvious reticence. We have to balance the medium-term needs of customers here with the modularity and thus maintainability of the design.
* We've _just_ got word that one of the failsafes we put into Amadeus's queries meant that nothing got deleted for them.  We are yet to find out why their data wasn't as expected.","08/Nov/18 7:48 PM PST;ukhalid;We've updated the staffing on this project to gain a higher momentum for increasing our chances of landing this feature ASAP. It's become clear to us (based on Amadeus' and other customer's concern of the perpetually growing Synchrony footprint) that despite GDPR being an important goal for this project, reducing in our storage footprint is an equally competing contender. Based on our investigation of the problem space and potential solutions in the past and the new/improved learnings from servicing Amadeus, we're going to build a solution that can help us with both problems (GDPR + Storage) correctly. We've already done a design spike to understand user journeys and will continue to do more for having a crisper understanding. We are also refactoring some logic in the Synchrony code base to make it easier to make upcoming changes for this project (fixing spaghetti code etc).

*Comment*
We haven't done estimations yet, so it's hard to set up due date for this project atm. But it's a bit easier to set target release for it - most likely, we won't be able to finish till Confluence 6.14 feature freeze date, and will merge it in 6.15 (or whatever is next).

Scaling Up: 
1. Briefed the other product analysts on the project. No real actions, except to use their judgement on upcoming product team projects and whether IPN can add value, with the understanding that it won't be fully ready to use by Product until late this year at the earliest.

2. Prioritized and selected 4 IPN campaigns that would have the greatest value to product. While they won't be ready for the notional cut off of Oct 1, to go into initial training packages, they would form extra 'Advanced' learnings that can be added later. We will, however, aim for at least one of these advanced tests to be deployed prior to October 1.

Development kickoff happened this week between Poland and Confluence dev team of Hasnae and Niraj. Development work on the IPN Plugin Upgrade starts next Monday, and will take two weeks. Initial meeting happening Monday to do final briefing to the dev team. Then Hasnae will work with Grzeg throughout the first week to get onboarded to the IPN plugin. It's likely that Grzeg will use a simple task, like a warning system, to onboard Hasnae. Then Hasnae should be able to make code changes to the plugin the following week with less help from Grzeg. 
While travel budget was approved for Hasnae to travel to Gdansk, unfortunately, her visa status prevented that, so evening VC meetings will be used to train.

*Scaling Up*
Next week we'll undertake the first Product Team training session on IPN use. It will be a two part session over Wednesday and Thursday evening. The end result will be the Product team being to plan and launch an IPN message. Training will include the technical details, tone and content, as well as the role of COPS (ownership and PR review, consulting etc). Confluence has selected a message as part of the Level Up work that they think will be a simple message that can be used for training. 

Met with Heinrich and Laura to introduce the 'Server IPN Hub'. Both said looks good, and Laura agree to add some learnings in the 'Best Practice' guide.

5. Implement IPN based notification in Confluence (~3 days)
Key takeaway: Learn how IPN is integrated into Confluence

Unfortunately Hasnae has to return to work on Confluence Search UI improvements next week, but will return to finish IPN upgrades when the Search UI Project finishes.

*Scaling Up*
1. The IPN Hub continues to be populated and Laura Renfroe is going to help populated some of the Key Learnings that her and Luke Heinrich have been working on throughout the quarter. 

2. Confluence Team (Simi Shaheed, Victoria Li, Michelle Mortimer, Hasnae Rehioui) undertook the first IPN Bootcamp for Product Teams. Only finished last night, but I've sent participant feedback forms out to get feedback so we can improve. 

3. As part of that bootcamp I created two new decks that be used for all product teams https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SCO/pages/316132463/In+Product+Notifications+IPN+Training+packs. They start with outlining a basic campaign and then scaling up to a more complex inline dialogue style message.","11/Oct/18 8:10 PM PDT;lhedge;*Technical Foundations*
We are now being blocked from sending IPN messages by https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/JSEV-2144. We've asked for timelines for when this will be fixed so that we can uderstand how to proceed.


*Scaling Up*
Received back only limited feedback from the training, but initial results are mixed with one participant confident they would be able to send a simple message, but 50 % confident of sending an advanced message. One other participant was only semi confident of sending any message. 
Takeaway comments include positive feedback on how the decks and training was set up. Further comments that COPS will need to help the team for the first few messages.","25/Oct/18 10:51 PM PDT;lhedge;*Technical Foundations*

After an initial 1 week of onboarding onto the IPN plugin, development work is now estimated at 4 extra weeks. Not two. But Confluence Team only has two weeks of development work they can put to this. SO we are probably now offtrack on this until we can resolve where and who will undertake this work.

**Scaling up**
IPN Plugin came online again this week after Bulldog Jira was upgraded to EAP 6. This means messages can now be sent. We've scheduled to send the first Confluence team message next week. ","22/Nov/18 7:35 PM PST;lhedge;**Technical Foundations**
Still finding a solution to the 2 week deficit in plugin work that needs to be done. We have reached out to SET/Jira here https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~mlech/pages/350372431/Proposal+IPN+use+for+SEFCON+bugs+-+Jira+Server
We believe there may be some performance issues related to sending multiple IPN messages here: https://bulldogwiki.internal.atlassian.com/wiki/display/~dluong/Performance+impact+on+Confluence+server+side+for+1+IPN?focusedCommentId=338264125#comment-338264125 We will continue to work to understand the impact of this problem and whether it become a blocker.

**Scaling up**
Confluence team sent their first IPN to local instances for testing. They are working on constructing and deploying the second part of that message.","06/Dec/18 6:46 PM PST;lhedge;**Technical Foundations**
Still finding a solution to the 2 week deficit in plugin work that needs to be done. We are still negotiating with Jira and SET for using IPN for SEFCONS and have asked that if they use it for this purpose then we still do need maintenance work.

Still trying to understand whether IPN causes significant performance problems, however, PS have indicated that they have told a large customer to switch it off.
","20/Dec/18 7:06 PM PST;lhedge;This week we agree to let SET use IPN for SEFCON notices, and thereby use it as a test for how non COPs teams could use the plugin. We have aligned on 1. Oversight and control 2. Process and procedure 3. Testing and reporting with the team and they have agreed to create a process document that can be followed in the event of a sefcon.","24/Jan/19 7:58 PM PST;lhedge;The first message sent entirely (kinda) by a product team (Confluence) was shipped just before Christmas and data has started coming in. The team is confident that they can manage the IPN process (planning, sending and measuring) independent of COPS. They have prioritized development work as part of Level Up in the coming two months.

We're waiting to see how Jira team will use IPN for sefcons if any arise. Will assess how COPS and SET work to improve any of the processes.

By adding description to repos we'll facilitate faster search and easier navigation across the repos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common problem devs suffer lays in branch creation process in JSW. When developer needs to create a branch first he has to select instance, then project, and repo. It is time consuming and annoying, especially taking into account that most customers use a single JIRA-project and a single repo for a project. Typical BbS instance hosts dozens of project with hundreds of repos. No wonder that developers often make mistakes creating branches in wrong repos. It is one of the reasons why developers prefer to use git CLI or IDE to create branches instead of ""Create branch"" link in the development panel.

In BbS there is a similar problem. When developer wants to create an issue from a comment, he needs to select JSW-instance, project in an ""Create an issue"" dialog. If there would be mapping we could set the default project in the ""Create branch"" dialog.

Saving developers time on routine actions is important. However, there is even bigger problem for large customer with multiple JSW instances and central BbS. If project keys on several JSW instances overlap, then when user clicks on an issue-key, BbS will try to get details from a PRIMARY JSW instanced (defined in Application links). Oftentimes PRIMARY instance is a wrong choice. It brings an array of other problems like inconsistent development information, incorrect Smart commits and workflow triggers.

It's IW and we've not progressed this week. Last week I started looking into what a giant whole-repo Webpack build would look like to gauge performance. Dick has gotten up to speed on Webpack and has been trying to find alternatives for how to differentiate entrypoints, internal APIs, and APIs. Next week he can spike the use of a manifest.json in BBS to reference internal core modules from a plugin. This might require code changes to the webpack-webresource-plugin to add a layer over providedDependencies.

We're expected to choose an option by Nov 30, so we'll timebox our spikes to 3-4 days and regroup on Friday.

We need to set dates for our milestones as well.

Dick has the WRMPlugin generated providedDependency manifests that plugin builds can consume. It's still pre-PR though, but should be done soon. We had discussed with Tim S to make sure our changes align with where the WRMPlugin is going, and he's on board with this approach.

Between interviews/recruiting workshops, Adam has been cleaning up our existing modules to follow correct naming conventions. We have written some scripts to generate webpack configuration inputs for us, and the more these conventions are followed, the more we can automate the webpack build. E.g. any JS file that needs to be immediately executed should be named *-init.js so it can be automatically included in the ""execute automatically"" config. Similarly, any file/module coming from our core build should begin with bitbucket/* so that we can automatically create entrypoints in core for anything that is depended on by a plugin. And any file coming from a plugin *shouldn't* be named bitbucket/* to avoid confusion (our convention is bitbucket\-X\-plugin/internal/* where X is the name of the plugin).

Dick has a PR open for the WRMPlugin generated providedDependency manifests that plugin builds can consume, and it looks pretty good. Tim and Daz are having a look. 

One of our planning sessions realized the huge risk in tracking dependencies for Soy templates that {call } other templates. Adam has been writing a script to rename all our Soy namespaces to match file locations, so that JS require() calls can be reliably made in place of global variable references. The soy-loader will need to be updated to support require() of called templates.

We've gone on a tangent making breaking changes for the 6.0 EAP. These will help us be more flexible with the ship date for Webpack since we can decouple the breaking changes from the Webpack work. Adam has spent the last week on that, and Dick will be taking over with those changes when Adam is on holiday after today. Plugins that are on stash dev and stash prod will need to be fixed to stop using the deprecated or internal stuff once the breakages are complete.

Because the EAP deadline is more important than a Webpack deadline, we haven't finished storypointing/planning the Webpack stuff (though we're already mostly aware of what needs doing). Will return to that once the urgent stuff is done.

Dick says: ""my script now reads plugin.xml, finds all web/client resources, checks for directory tags, finds the resources on disk, injects the less/soy into the js. Still needs tweaking, but making good progress""

Adam has been updating the atlassian-soy-loader to follow template dependencies and this is in PR now.

We still haven't finished storypointing/planning the Webpack stuff. I think we're best to keep working for now - we know what we need to do and jsut need to do it, though we haven't added milestone deadlines to help estimate.

Progress in the past week included:
 * Active Object library and Active objects plugin changes complete and snapshot releases were performed
 * Work stated on:
 ** atlassian-sal
 ** atlassian-hazelcast-extras
 ** atlassian-trusted-apps
 ** atlassian-cache
 ** atlassian-soy-templates

*Next Week*
 * Continue platform updates with the goal of, in a few weeks, to attempt to start Bitbucket Server using milestone/snapshot builds of the platform dependencies
 * I will be away Wed-Fri next week, so next update will be 1-June-2018

*Risks*
 * Many unknown unknowns in the platform updates
 * Lack of participation in the platform updates by other projects probably means the potential for required re-work, as the specific requirements for each product may not be sufficiently accounted for.
 * CI builds for platform modules are not healthy, increasing the amount of manual testing required. The Java 9 builds have been poisoning build agents due to a misconfiguration, so we have disabled these. Java 10 and 11-ea builds are not available. Also on Monday 21-May all platform modules Bamboo plans will be disabled because they don't have an owner

This week we have been focusing on developing a strategy to see the Java Platform work through to completion. With the loss of Michael Heemskerk on the project it had stalled.
Bitbucket Server will continue this work and as of 3-Sep-2018 will dedicate a team of 3-4 to see it through to completion. That team will initially consist of Juan Palacios, Bryan Turner and Ben Humphreys with Nokolay Loboda supporting from Gdansk.

We will be working towards releasing a milestone release for the entire set of modules/plugins hopefully within about 2 weeks. This should permit the products complete the majority of their Java 11 upgrade tasks. We will then be waiting for a few final external dependencies (e.g. Spring 5.1) to be released before we are in a position to do a final release of Platform 5.0.

New:
* Spring 5.1 release date slips. It looks like Spring 5.0 won’t be formally Java 11 compatible, where Spring 5.1 is.

All effort has been directed towards the Server Java Platform 5.0 updates. See the status report on PC-6881 for how that is tracking.

This project remains at-risk as PC-6881 is at-risk.

All effort has been directed towards the Server Java Platform 5.0 updates. See the status report on PC-6881 for how that is tracking.

*Next week*
Much like this week, all effort next week will be on the platform updates. We are starting to consume milestone versions of those artifacts in Bitbucket, but are currently blocked by the unavailability of an updated version of Embedded Crowd.

*Why still at-risk?*
This project remains at-risk as PC-6881 is at-risk. Furthermore, since the team allocated to Java 11 support in Bitbucket Server has been working on the Platform 5 updates the “other” Bitbucket Server 6.0 work has not been started. At this point is is very unlikely BBS 6.0 will ship in Nov 2018, far more likely is Jan 2019.","11/Oct/18 9:34 PM PDT;behumphreys;Note: I have updated the ship date (moved it back 9 weeks) as we have decided to add a 5.16 release and ship 6.0 this after new year. This change was required as Bitbucket team had to pick up the Server Platform work (PC-6881) which meant the actual Bitbucket work has been delayed significantly.

*This week*
Most effort has been directed towards the Server Java Platform 5.0 updates. See the status report on PC-6881 for how that is tracking.

However, *big news*, we have updated Bitbucket Server (on a branch) to use all the new platform modules and now have all test passing (well except for five but the causes are known and unrelated to Platform 5). This is a good indication that the platform work is almost complete.

*Next week*
Much like this week, most effort next week will be on the platform updates. We will however be taking some steps towards getting the platform 5 updates merged to Bitbucket Server's master branch, for eventual deployment to dogfooding.","25/Oct/18 9:38 PM PDT;behumphreys;*This week*

Since the Platform 5 work is nearly complete this week has marked a shift, with more of our time being spent on Bitbucket.

Noteworthy items:
- We have Bitbucket Server now running on all the platform 5 modules with all unit and integration tests from the pull request build (except a little unrelated mirroring issue) on both Java 8 and 11
- Updated our builds to Maven 3.5 in preparation for the Platform 5 work being merged to master.
- Daniel has started work on upgrading to Hazelcast 3.11. It appears the scope of work may actually be less than we expected, and we may actually be able to get off the fork and use Hazelcast as is
- Frank has upgraded Bitbucket to use Hibernate 5.2.17. This is a useful step in the path towards upgrading to Hibernate 5.3


*Next week*

We will be spending some time on finalising the platform 5 work that is being tracked in PC-6881, so its worth having a read of that.

We will be working towards getting the platform 5 branch ready to merge to master, so dogfooding can begin. There are a few hurdles we will have to tackle, probably next week, in order to get there:

- The release build fails because some of our javadoc and REST documentation generation plugins are not compatible with the new dependencies we are using
- Need to update the plugins we run on stash-dev but are not bundled with the product, as they are likely incompatible with platform 5
","01/Nov/18 7:34 PM PDT;behumphreys;*This week*
Very little work on Bitbucket 6.0 was done this week. Most of the team were involved in some challenging Bitbucket DoS cases. Frank has however started looking at the Hibernate 5.3 upgrade, and Daniel has been testing the Hazelcast 3.11 upgrade.

The three largest pieces of work here are almost done; specifically:

- The Platform 5 branch is ready to be merged in master. This will happen next week, probably Monday!
- We are ready to release final versions of all the platform 5 modules. This will happen 26 thru 28-Nov-2018. See PC-6881 for details
- The Hazelcast 3.11 upgrade is in a pull request and ready to merge. This will happen next week.
- The Hibernate 5.3 upgrade has made massive progress, with [Frank having put up a pull request on the hazelcast-hibernate project|https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate5/pull/48]

- Releasing final versions of all the Platform 5 modules
- Merging Hazelcast 3.11 branch to master","02/Dec/18 3:43 PM PST;behumphreys;*Past week (26 - 30 November)*

Big progress this week, with 2 of the 3 largest items required for Java 11 support being merged to master!

- Merged Platform 5 branch to master (platform 5 is still a milestone release, final builds are pending)
- Merged Hazelcast 3.11 update to master. After 4 years, we have finally moved off the fork and are running mainline Hazelcast.
- Frank’s [hazelcast-hibernate 5.3|https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-hibernate5/pull/48] pull request on the open source project (hazelcast-hibernate5) has been merged. Not only is this a big step towards us running on Hibernate 5.3, but is also a substantial open source contribution.
- Frank has spiked the upgrade to Crowd 3.3 and it looks like it will work for us, so we have advised Crowd team (Marcin Kemp) that they can proceed with the Platform 5 upgrades in Crowd 3.x, rather than creating a fork of an old version like they had to do for Jira.
- Frank has successfully upgraded Bitbucket Server to Hibernate 5.4. A [pull request is open|https://stash.dev.internal.atlassian.com/projects/STASH/repos/stash/pull-requests/12695/overview], though we are still waiting for a final release of Hibernate 5.4 before this can be merged. If the release is not forthcoming, we can ship with 5.3 plus some workarounds.

In a spot of bad news, the Platform 5 final releases that were going to go ahead last week were put on hold since Jira have informed us they now plan to ship Jira 8.0 with AUI 8 and some changes are required to the platform modules to support this. At this point there is a good chance this chance will not impact the ship date for Bitbucket 6.0, but that may change in future if the AUI 8 upgrades require some changes that break compatibility with AUI 7.x.


*Next week (3 - 7 December)*

- Move away from old versions of Fugue and atlassian-util-concurrent in Bitbucket server so we can remove those exports
- Start work for upgrading to Elasticsearch 6.5
- Work with Crowd team to ensure platform 5 updates are made to Crowd 3.x.


*Risks*
- A platform 5 compatible version of ATST is still not available. We are dependant on the CSS team to carry out this work.
- A platform 5 compatible version of Crowd is still not available. We are dependent on the Crowd team to carry out this work.
- Jira now plans to ship Jira 8.0 with AUI 8. Bitbucket’s plans are however unchanged, and still plan to ship Bitbucket 6.0 with AUI 7.x. If incompatible changes need to be made to the platform for AUI 8 compatibility then this may further increase the scope of work in the Platform 5 project.","08/Dec/18 4:10 PM PST;behumphreys;*Past week (3 - 7 November)*

- A platform 5 compatible version of Crowd is still not available. Crowd team have advised us they do not have time to do this work, so it will have to be picked up by the Bitbucket team. This may put some pressure on the schedule.","06/Jan/19 4:26 PM PST;behumphreys;*Since last update*

- Elasticsearch 6.5 upgrade has been merged and deployed to stash-dev
- A spot of bad news: On 16-Jan-2019 Oracle released the second Java 11 patch, 11.0.2.

I have raised [BBSDEV-19120|https://bulldog.internal.atlassian.com/browse/BBSDEV-19120] to track the investigation and fix. Some testing suggests that an upgrade to BND may resolve the issue, though this is a major version upgrade (Note this impacts Jira 8.0 too, I've asked them to look at it and they confirm Jira is broken on 11.0.2).

Worth noting that the AdoptOpenJDK project has stopped producing JRE build for Java 11 (apparently unintentionally), they have JDK builds, and they do have a JRE for the original 11.0.0 release but not the patch releases. This doesn't directly impact the scope of the project this PC ticket describes, but we had hoped to ship Bitbucket 6.0 with AdoptOpenJDK JRE 11.0.1 or later.

However since we would like to deliver Better SSO before Summit 2019, we've decided that it would be better to handle SSO first and do not delay it further by focusing on preparing additional version.

The scope for Crowd 3.4.0 release is:
* New AUI 7.9 and other improvements that are required by this upgrade
* Better SSO based on SAML (note that we are also making a change in the auth plugin so that Server versions may also work with Better SSO)
* Further adoption of React.js in Crowd:
** Rendering audit log filters using React
** Session config screen rewritten in React
* This version will not support Java 11

*Status*
* UI parts and backend for configuration of BetterSSO on Crowd side is under review
* We are working on preparing an environment for doing cross product demo (at the moment for DC only)

*Next*
* We have one week break for the innovation week, then there is x-mas break where we will be working on 20% projects
* In new calendar year 2019 we will be working on launching dogfooding of Better SSO on bulldog and EAC

We have moved this into a MVP phase 1. This will ship just 'Offline Mode' to the users, which is defined as a local cache of the versioning / supported platform information for Jira. This will present users with a generic upgrade path using that cache, and also notify it's out-of-date. We will also release ATST to Jira every time there is a release until the online mode is complete. Online mode will be complete when the microservice is finished.

The ship date was moved quite far ahead due to innovation sprint & Christmas meaning most of the team is unavailable.

* Upgrading Lucene is on track for 22nd June as estimated by the team.

* There are two other related streams of work that Team Delta will work on after the upgrade –
 # Performance fixes/improvements to make sure the new Lucene performs _at least_ on par with the old (minimum target for 8.0), if not better.
 # Index structure optimization as a performance quick win. (Note: This one is not directly tied to the new Lucene, so I have suggested creating a different PC ticket for this.)

The team is in the middle of analyzing 1 and 2. Part of this work (some think most of it) has to be in the first EAP (mid-July), and the rest in the second EAP.

(Stream 1 and 2 analysis, and also some interesting 8.x work items are here – [https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/JIRASERVER/Lucene+upgrade+-+Phase+B].)

Looking at the current scope and loose estimates of the 1 and 2 streams, I don't see any red flags for 8.0.

* JSD and JPOS have plans in place for reactive changes to the Lucene upgrade.

Overall, the ""Lucene"" initiative is on track, in my opinion.

-----------

* At the moment, the Java upgrade bucket seems to be a higher risk than Lucene, but we will know more as we go further with the analysis.

Thx mate!,"19/Jun/18 2:32 AM PDT;smasood;Changing the status to 'At Risk' because of uncertainties with the platform upgrade+Java upgrade work stream.
 * We do not yet have estimates for this work stream as we were expecting, and it looks like there are blockers to getting those. The team is trying to get a Jira expert on board to help with this.
 * Our original expectation was we could do the platform upgrade in 8.0, and Java upgrade itself shortly afterwards in a 8.x release. However, a doubt was raised whether Java upgrade would be considered a breaking change that can't be released in a point release. We have an ongoing DACI for this – [https://extranet.atlassian.com/display/JIRASERVER/DACI%3A+In+what+Jira+version+should+we+add+Java+11+and+OpenJDK+support]
 * Impact on JSD (and JPOS) is unknown. They can't analyze the impact until they know the details of what we are going to do on the Jira side.

Lucene:
 * Lucene upgrade and related work is going well. EAP 1 could be delayed by a week or so because we want to get certain breaking changes in it. Overall, IMO, this work stream is on track.","29/Jun/18 1:30 AM PDT;smasood;Current progress and risks: 

 * Still don't know the impact of Java upgrade on 8.0 GA. Current target is to get a plan in place by 13th July.

* Lucene Phase A is finished as planned this week. Great work, Delta!

* Lucene Phase B (breaking changes) will take four weeks longer than initially planned. The team would like to get all of Phase B (which means all breaking changes) in EAP1, rather than leave some for EAP2. This is to enable app developers to give us feedback on API changes early, so we have time to fix it by EAP2.

 As a side effect of this, there is a proposal to change the EAP schedule from the current EAP1 and EAP2 to doing multiple biweekly EAPs, and a “breaking change freeze”. We are still evaluating whether this is a good idea. We expect to take a call on it next week.

 If we are sticking with the “two EAP approach”, EAP1 will move to mid-August from the current mid-July.

* Given the above, we are unable to plan a high-confidence date for 8.0 GA at this point. We expect to have a high-confidence GA date for 8.0 by 20th July, taking into account Jira Family teams’ plans for Java upgrade and Lucene upgrade.

 

Next week:
 * Decide on the EAP approach (“two big EAPs” vs “multiple biweekly EAPs with a breaking changes freeze”).
 * Monitor Java upgrade planning progress.
 * Check with Jira Family teams when they are planning to work on their Java upgrade schedule given the 13th July date when JSW will finish the spike.

 ","20/Jul/18 5:33 AM PDT;rjozwiak;*Current progress*
* JSW got involved into spikes this week to help out estimate JSD Java Upgrade. JSD Java upgrade is the major risk for the 8.0 schedule, because of lack of devs able to work on JSD Java Upgrade. Once the effort is known, hopefully next week, JSW / JSD will work on mitigation.

* Gathered best guestimates from the major 8.0 work streams, besides JSD Java Upgrade, resulting in setting possible release date at the end of October with number of EAPs in between.
More detailed 8.0 plan: https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JIRASERVER/pages/147905070/Jira+8.0+Plan

* Lucene upgrade started phase B and as expected uncovered performance issues to solve.
* Agile in 3 seconds start got postponed by 2 weeks to work on In Application Apdex project - it doesn't impact the 8.0 schedule
* Other 8.0 projects proceed as planned this week

*Next week*
* Monitoring JSD Java Upgrade results and hopefully working out 8.0 delay mitigation 
* Agreeing on priorities for 8.0 Smaller breaking changes and updating them to 8.0 schedule https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JIRASERVER/pages/147893439/8.0+-+Smaller+breaking+changes
* Identifying Server Integrations and ATST dependencies for 8.0 and adding to schedule
* Monitor current pace vs plan of Lucene phase B upgrade after first phase B sprint

*Risks*
* JSD Java Upgrade unknown estimates and lack of devs to work on  - major 8.0 risk at the moment, High likelihood / High impact
* Lucene Upgrade phase B performance issues needing more then planned - Medium likelihood / High impact
* 8.0 smaller breaking changes resulting in postponing 8.0 schedule - Low likelihood / High impact
* Server integrations and ATST unknown dependencies on 8.0 - Low likelihood / Medium Impact
* 8.0 upgrade experience delaying 8.0 - Low likelihood / High impact

As a part of JSD capacity restructuring, we've committed 3 devs to Jira pipeline work. What they are working on can be  found on JSD capacity page.
https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDS/pages/142713353/JSD+Capacity

Current status:
# We are working on Lucene Upgrade and AGDS update (till 3.15)
# Beyond 3.15 we are putting 2 devs on Lucene upgrade and 1 dev on jQuery upgrade (this came late and we anticipate risk here so starting early on jQuery). This work should take us to early September.
# In September, we would be putting 1 dev on Java Platform upgrade and 2 devs will continue on Phase B upgrade (Ballpark estimations for them is mid-October)  .

Risks:
# 8.0 will be delayed because JSD spread thin and don't have additional capacity to pick up Java changes in parallel with Lucene
# Lucene Phase B, Java Platform and jQuery are in flight in Jira, it is hard for JSD to look at the changes and estimate. Hence, estimation provided on the capacity page is educated guess of what we know right now.

Mitigation Plan:
 As highlighted on this page https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDS/pages/244144587 , we have 3 options:
# Delay the release and wait for JSD finish the changes (Slowest and not recommended)
# Jira team (if capacity available) start picking-up JSD platform upgrade and JSD helps them while concentrating on Lucene (Good pace - Recommended approach)
# Jira picks up Java upgrade for JSD and runs with it (Fastest - Error-prone due to knowledge gap)
",23/Jul/18 8:11 AM PDT;cdeatsch;Thanks [~sgupta2]. Exactly what I needed.,"07/Aug/18 10:59 PM PDT;pscobie;Hi there - the migration to Cloud Project Central has hit a snag.

PC status updates are not being captured as comments like they used to (the PC team is planning to build a workaround with connect, webhooks, and micros though). For now please publish your status update as a status report but also as a comment until the fix is deployed. Hit up the Server Program Management Q&A booth room in Stride if you have any questions.","13/Aug/18 4:53 AM PDT;rjozwiak;* Team Highlanders completed the JSD Java upgrade spike they were working on, based on which the JSD team does not expect a delay in the current 8.0 GA date (30 Oct) due to the Java Upgrade work. 
* However, JSD suspects the scope of work due to the jQuery upgrade could be larger than previously thought. I am keeping the status ""At Risk"" due to this.
JSD is syncing with Team Monsters to get more clarity on the jQuery work. We expect to get more clarity on this, and hence more confidence in the GA date by end of this week.
* Technical solution chosen for the Agile in 3 Seconds project might be impacted due to a API change by the Lucene Project. Impact is unknown at the moment and Team Flash is looking at this. We don't expect this to impact the GA date, but in the worst case, might impact the breaking changes freeze date (27 August).
* Monitoring Lucene Phase B scope closely.

Other stuff
-----------
* Diminished capacity in Gdańsk office this month due to vacations, Summit, offsites put pressure on the breaking changes freeze date (27th August).","28/Aug/18 7:28 AM PDT;smasood;Summary:

* We are delaying GA by two weeks to 16 November. (Full schedule https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JIRASERVER/pages/147905070/Jira+8.0+Plan)
* This is driven by the Lucene project needing more time than expected. We are delayed roughly by three weeks on phase B.
* All other works streams are on track, and are expected to finish as originally planned on 24th September. We are NOT adding additional scope or making any other changes to these work streams because of the delay in GA. The only change is to the Lucene project schedule. (Teams: Please stick to your original plans.)
* We will ask other teams to help Team Delta with some of the non-core Lucene things they are working on after 24th September. (Teams: Please expect this and plan for it.)

Other stuff:

* We released the first public EAP on 14th August. We will be releasing a new EAP every two weeks (https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/jira-8-0-eaps-are-here/22358)
* Several Summit talks related to 8.0 are happening next week. Fingers crossed!
* We decided to release 7.13 in early October and make it our next Enterprise Release. (https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/JIRASERVER/blog/2018/08/20/271878124/Meet+Jira+7.13+Next+Jira+Enterprise+Release+to+be)","31/Aug/18 7:33 AM PDT;rjozwiak;*Major risks this week:*
* jQuery major risk occurred with additional 500hrs needed to finish the work. JSW / JSD will work on mitigation on Monday
* Java Upgrade Platform was off track during the week, but BBS is taking over with 3 devs team + Nikolay from GDN looking to ship it by 14th September and unblocking other teams and mitigating the risk for Jira 8.
* 8.0 upgrade experience is a risk still, CSS Eng is working on scenarios next week, that should enable estimations of 8.0 impact
* OpenJDK for JSW is delaying Java 11 upgrade by 2 weeks, not impacting 8.0 GA, but might move some EAPs scope
* Lucene upgrade phase B still remains a risk and is closely monitored

Other 8.0 projects continue as planned this week

*Next week*
* Releasing EAP2 on 4th September
* Decision on jQuery upgrade mitigation
* Lucene Upgrade phase B checkpoint if we're on track after Delta team planning
","07/Sep/18 4:29 AM PDT;smasood;* Lots of great feedback from Summit. :)

* EAP02 released on 4 Sep as planned.
* We have started getting EAP feedback from vendors. This will increase as we release more EAPs and there is more content for vendors to play with. 
* We are planning to actively reach out to more vendors and engage them on 8.0.

* Team Pirates will take over reindexing optimization for upgrades from Delta once they're done with JPT after 18 Sep 2018. 

*Risks this week*

* jQuery for JSW is still a risk for the breaking changes freeze date, but is in much better shape and progressing well. We have more people on standby in case they are needed. We will take a call on this next week.
* Guava upgrade (part of platform upgrade stream) is still a potential risk. We will know more about it early next week.
* Waiting for CSS Engineering team to provide upgrade scenarios so we can prioritise work for those scenarios for 8.x.
* We would like to dogfood 8.0 on Bulldog asap, but we need to resolve some details, mainly the impact on JPOS, before this can happen. Working on this next week.

* Other 8.0 projects continue as planned this week.

*Next week*

* Releasing EAP03 on 13th September.
* Resolving our approach to releasing JSD in EAPs.

* JSD lucene phase B seems less work then expected with possibility to end in 1-2 weeks
* added JSW Pirates team to work on 8.0 upgrade experience part (removing additional reindex during upgrade)

but... new risks occurred this week:
* JSD loosing 3 people and work on next ER bugs impacting 8.0 JSD plans
* Java Platform upgrade needs more time which impacts 8.0 JSW Java upgrade
* AUI bump for JSW seems to be a strong should have, to add to 8.0 scope. JSW Monsters spiking it this week, decision to be made next week.

After consulting with 8.0 teams and SLT moved GA date to 7th December because:
Additional testing time is needed to have better quality including: 
Additional time on JAC and bulldog dogfooding,
Logs scanner added besides CI tests, to look for exceptions. It resulted in almost 40 exceptions that JSW teams will investigate
While working on Platform upgrade new x-product components unknown dependencies occurring with: UPM upgrade, Embedded Crowd, ATST etc. JSW working with BBS, Crowd and Platform team on them. More details: https://hello.atlassian.net/browse/PC-6528
EAP: Released EAP5 last week, created EAP and bulldog / JAC schedule release plan with Jira Family teams.
JSD started work on EAP5, agreed that JSD will try to reach EAP5 and 6 together in one bulldog release on 26th Oct

x-product components upgrade delaying 8.0 GA. Other teams are helping.
Jira Family teams having none time buffer in schedule because of Platform upgrade breaking changes still being worked on.
Server integrations Jira 8.0 dependencies require closer monitoring - only one person working on them, might be at risk
No comms with CST team yet about JAC upgrade for 8.0, to be solved this week

*Derisked last week*
Good progress on Lucene upgrade phase C with performance improvements:
Index size is half of the size it was in 7.13.
Really good indexing times, almost 2.5 times faster then 7.13.

* Recruitment - *Behind but progressing*
** Synced with Rob Allen about recruitment expectations and confirmed that due to overcommitment by recruiting, we will be roughly a quarter behind our original plans. Once the dedicated Server recruiter starts at the end of August we can experiment to catch up some lost time.
** Mack Keegan is making rapid progress in sourcing Snr Eng Mgr candidates. 1 candidate currently in the interviewing pipeline, talking with Marty tonight.
** Open question around the titling for the Snr Eng Mgr. Sonia's Head of Eng title has established a precedent for M5s in BLR. The market expectations may be at Director level for the level of experience we're looking for. Mack is following up with Manoj to find out more. There was apparently an understanding reached between Sri/BJR/Ozden/Rob and others. Penny has discussed with Rob and following up with Ozden and BJR. (Sri is on leave)
* Ecosystem - *Going well*
** Met with Sven this week to discuss his role as remote dev TL for the Eco team. Expectation is that he will boot up the team and hand it over to local leaders once running successfully. 
** First step is for Sven to put together role descriptions before he goes on leave.
** Neil and Niall reached consensus on Manila handling first-tier dev support.
** Current plan is not to hire dedicated Server Support folks but for Support to be an expectation of devs. This will be revisited after we test the hiring waters.
* JSD - *Going well*
** No action this week - waiting for the recruiter to start.
* Boomerangers - *Going well*
** Reached out to every Boomeranger to confirm if they are committed (not just interested).
** Final-round interviews with Dinesh and Graham are starting.","12/Aug/18 4:05 PM PDT;pwyatt;Status report for 10th August 2018:

* Recruitment - *Behind but progressing*
** Reached a compromise agreement with all parties re: titling of the role. We will keep it at Snr Eng Mgr for now, but de-emphasise the title in recruiting efforts. We will revisit if we get back strong signals that the title is affecting the candidate pipeline. This is because changing the title has significant side-effects in Server, and we want to avoid a bait-and-switch of promising a ""Head of Eng"" title before we are committed to it.
** Interviews with another two candidates showed that both were too junior and had never led leaders. Will work with Mack to get more senior candidates into the pipeline.
* Ecosystem - *Going well*
** Sven has analysed the UPM source and determined that it was not as difficult as was previously thought. Based on this he has put together a role description for a standard Java dev.
** Met with Karen Cross to discuss whether the dev docs writer should be co-located with the eco team in BLR or with a new dev docs team in SYD. If in Sydney, the dev skill will need to be higher as the writer will need to be more independent. Agreement was reached - Karen will attempt to hire in Sydney now (as BLR hiring is not ready to start yet anyway), and if unsuccessful by the time BLR Server hiring ramps up, we will look at BLR instead. Currently considering one internal candidate in Sydney.
* JSD/General - *Going well*
** As many people in BLR will have two managers, have been working to define the roles and responsibilities of the two types of managers to avoid confusion and conflict - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVER/pages/262742799/Local+vs+Remote+Managers+-+Roles+and+Responsibilities . Sparred with Mat Lawrence and discussed with various leaders 1-on-1. The plan for the top-level triad is looking pretty solid at this stage, but the balance of solid-line vs dotted-line for JSD is still controversial. 
* Boomerangers - *Going well*
** 2 out of 8 candidates have had their final-round interviews, the rest still to come.","16/Aug/18 10:33 PM PDT;pwyatt;Status report for 17th August 2018:

* Engineering Recruitment - *Behind but progressing*
** Our dedicated Server Engineering recruiter in Bengaluru - Priya - starts on Monday (yay!). 
** The first hiring priority for Priya will be the two Ecosystem developers, while Mackenzie will continue to run the Senior Engineering Manager search. Following that will be the two JSD devs.
** As much as possible has been documented for Priya to get started, so we lose as little time as possible in cross-timezone to-and-froing - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVER/pages/269237844/Info-Dump+for+BLR+Server+Engineering+Recruiter
** Mack has started bringing more senior leaders - Directors and Senior Directors as well as the upper-end of the Senior Engineering Managers - into the Snr Eng Mgr pipeline. On paper, candidates are now looking closer to what we're looking for. Anticipating interviews with 3 candidates next week. We have a shared understanding that this process will be slow and careful to be sure we get exactly the right person in the role.
** The Server QE team have finalised the job description for the Senior QE role - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~tgabe/pages/244115220/Senior+Quality+Engineer+for+Server+BLR
* Design Recruitment - *Getting started*
** Judd has written the Job ad for the Design Manager and it should be posted soon - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDES/pages/246419423/Hiring+-+Server+Design+Manager+Bengaluru
** Judd and Vandana have defined the Design Manager interview process - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDES/pages/264770026/Design+Interviewing+-+Server+Design+Manager
** The PM/Design recruiter starts on the 27th of August; Manoj is helping directly in the meantime.
* PM Recruitment - *Waiting*
** Some referrals coming through via Dinesh, Keshav is doing basic screening.
** Otherwise no progress - waiting for the recruiter to start on the 27th.
** PM bandwidth is likely to be a bottleneck in the pre-Summit timeframe. Once the recruiter starts we can work with them to make the best use of our limited PM availability.
* Ecosystem - *Going well*
** Karen Cross (Content Design) is interviewing an internal candidate for the dev docs role next week.
** Reached an agreement with Seb Ruiz (Cloud Ecosystem) on the plan and timing for the UPM handover. https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVER/pages/267139125/Server+Ecosystem+Bengaluru+-+UPM+Handover+Plan . To be on track to start handover in January 2019, we need to have made at least one offer to a Server Ecosystem dev candidate by the end of September (roughly 6 weeks from today). At this stage this seems feasible.
* JSD - *Going well*
** Continued working on proposed reporting lines/roles for the team. Healthy debate within leadership about solid-line vs dotted-line reporting.
** Worked with JSD leaders to define the expectations and roles of the first two JSD devs.
* Boomerangers - *Going well*
** 4 out of 8 candidates remaining to be interviewed - mostly waiting for people to return from leave this month. Given the delayed hiring, we don't anticipate sending any Server Boomerangers until Q3. 
* Onboarding - *Going well*
** The JSD team has revamped their onboarding process and tried it out on two new starters in Sydney - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SDS/blog/2018/08/09/266091216/Onboarding+more+quickly+on+JSD+Server . The initial feedback was positive. They are continuing to improve it and will try again with the next new Sydney starter in September.
** Cameron has agreed to run a strategy onboarding class for the BLR new hires. He is following up with Rhi to find out how BJR used to do it in SYD. ","31/Aug/18 4:32 AM PDT;pwyatt;Status report for 31st August 2018:

* Engineering Recruitment - *Behind but progressing*
** Priya has posted job ads for the first two dev roles.
** Completed 3 Engineering Manager interviews this week - 2 of the candidates were too junior, but the other is promising and I will continue with the next round next week.
** We have finished working through the backlog of lower-level Engineering Manager candidates. Mack has lined up several Director and Senior Director level candidates for screening next week. From now on we will target this level of seniority. 
** Rob and Mack are obtaining salary information to get an early sense if we will be able to meet these Director/Senior Directors' salary expectations. I am investigating with the SLT if we can uplevel the role to M6 if needed.
* Design and PM Recruitment - *Getting started*
** The new PM/Design recruiter has started but I'm yet to sync with them. Have asked Manoj to introduce us next week.
** One of the outcomes from last week's offsite was a decision to unblock the PM recruitment process pre-Summit by getting the job description and interview process defined this week. However, with Keshav unexpectedly out for much of this week, this didn't happen. I plan to compensate by starting with Design, which is less affected by Summit.
* Ecosystem - *Going well*
** As mentioned above, the first Ecosystem job ads have been posted and candidates have started coming through the pipeline.
* JSD - *Going well*
** Discussed the strategy for PM/Design hiring with the JSD leadership triad this week. The conclusion was to focus on establishing PM and Design relationships with the new JSD devs, and invest in getting the right top-level PM and Design leaders in BLR, and only then look at filling the JSD-level PM/Design roles in BLR.
* Boomerangers - *Going well*
** All interviews are complete. Matt Jeffrey will communicate results to candidates next week.
** Pinning down the cost (and thus whether we can send 3 or 4 people for Server within the allocated budget) is the next step. This is a non-trivial task being done by a third-party (PwC). Matt is handling this.

** Starting 3-times-weekly standups for Server Engineering recruitment
* Design and PM Recruitment - *Getting Started*
** Sneha Rao is the PM/Design recruiter - both Judd and Penny have met with her to give background.
** Her first priorities are 1) The site-level PM leader, 2) The Server Design leader.
** We will get organised with the info needed for the Server PM role when the PMs return from Summit
** We have 1 design manager candidate in phone screen stage with Judd next week.

* Engineering Recruitment - *At Risk*
** First offer out today - a P3 Dev for JSD. This is out of priority order because this was a Marketplace candidate who was better-suited for JSD. Marketplace have offered to onboard him so he doesn't start alone; or we may fly him to Sydney instead. Thank you Marketplace!
** The plan for UPM handover ( https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SERVER/pages/267139125/Server+Ecosystem+Bengaluru+-+UPM+Handover+Plan ) has a latest-possible milestone of first (Ecosystem) Server dev offer out by 29/9/2018. As I don't count the JSD dev we were given for free by Marketplace, we only have a week to hit this goal, and only one candidate past the coding test stage so far. As per the page, if we don't hit the date we will start working with Seb on a fallback plan.
** We do not have ads up yet or pipelines in place for several of the must-start-in-Q2 roles (2xJSD devs, 1xEST Team Lead). Priya will start preparing the Team Lead job ad next week.
** 52 active dev candidate applications, 34 are in the interview pipeline. Coding tests have started but only one candidate has passed so far. We have introduced HackerRank for direct applications to reduce time spent on weak candidates. It is having some issues but Priya is working directly with the HackerRank team to resolve them.
** Server Engineering Manager candidates are finally progressing past the initial stages - 2 have failed the Triad interview, 1 has passed the management interview with Dinesh (and will now go back for the triad interview), several more coming through behind them.
** Server QE recruitment process is ramping up - Priya has been briefed on the needs of the role and the QE team is refreshing the interview process.
** A third-party recruitment partner is being brought in and will start delivering us candidates on Monday. Also discussing the possibility of a hiring blitz with Manoj and Priya, possibly combined with Marketplace.
** From Monday we are combining hiring pools with Marketplace so that candidates will go to the right place for the business, rather than to the team whose recruiter spotted them first.
* Design and PM Recruitment - *Getting Started*
** Design Manager candidates are moving through the pipeline.
** The ad for the top-level Server PM is going up today.
** We do not have ads up yet or pipelines in place for the EST PM or Designer, both of which are must-start-in-Q2 roles.

*** Possibly two offers going out early next week to P4/P5 devs. Exciting news, but we'll see - many candidates have gone through the pipeline but none have made it to offer stage yet. 
*** Priya and Subodh have been experimenting with ways to get more P4/P5 hires. We may need to compromise on unit testing skill - in which case we will need a plan for upskilling them once they join.
*** Priya is aiming for 8-10 P4/P5 interviews next week.
** Dev TLs
*** Two M3s have passed all but the final stage and are going for management/values interviews next week.
*** Two M4-level candidates are in the pipeline and we are talking them into interviewing for M3-level roles with plans for future growth.
** One M5 candidate (a referral from Ken) has passed the triad interview, and if the debrief goes well next week, would proceed to management interview next week.
** QE hiring has started, with several candidates being sent the take-home exercise, but we will not focus on this until we have a healthy P4/P5 dev pipeline.
* PM and Design Hiring - *Progressing*
** I don't have updated details this week, but I believe Judd is making an offer for one (Senior?) Designer for Server.
** Keshav has given positive feedback for several GPM candidates.","16/Nov/18 3:06 AM PST;pwyatt;Status report for 16th November 2018:

* Engineering Recruitment - *Accelerating*
** Subodh and Priya are still doing outstanding work here.
** We are planning an engineering recruitment blitz for the first week of December - pending confirmation that we have enough candidates.
** A P4 dev has accepted our offer (yay!) - this is the first hire through the Server pipeline. He will form the BLR Server Ecosystem team, just in time to start taking over UPM from Cloud.
** The P5 dev offer is ready but the candidate is currently travelling.
** The first batch of M3s in the pipeline have been rejected, but Priya is sourcing some more.
** One promising M4 is having a final-round interview on Monday.
** Our primary M5 candidate will also have his final-round interview early next week. Two other M5s in the pipeline.
* Design - *Progressing*
** We have one design offer accepted (yay!) and she will start in January.
** We have one very strong Design Manager candidate in the pipeline.
* PM - *Progressing*
** One senior PM had a debrief this week - still finding out the results of this
** Two GPM candidates are still in the pipeline.
* Reprioritising - *Under negotiation*
** In order to get one team to ""Owning Features"" in FY19, the SLT has proposed reprioritising hiring the JSD triad ahead of the EST triad. This would have the impact that the EST team would be unlikely to deliver any value this FY. This proposal is still under negotiation with the CSS team and needs final SLT signoff. 
* Onboarding - *Needs work*
** With engineering hiring accelerating, I need to get moving on onboarding.
** Dee has put together an updated video guide to the Server Quality strategy for new hires - https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AVENGERS/pages/346065388/Server+Team+Quality+Quickstart+Video","29/Nov/18 10:38 PM PST;pwyatt;Status report for 30th November 2018:

* Engineering Recruitment - *Accelerating*
** We have a new Server Engineering recruiter - welcome, Meenaxi!
** Blitz
*** The recruitment blitz, for P4/P5 backend devs, has been confirmed for the week of the 10th-14th December. 
*** 3 Server folks - Thomas, Lachlan and Niraj - are travelling from Sydney to participate.
*** We currently have 11 confirmed candidates for the Blitz - 5 who have passed code pairing and 6 who have passed screening but not yet coding 
*** With one more week to go we are tracking green on the original promise of 5 code pair selects and 10 full loop (post screen) for the blitz.
** We have one P5 dev offer for Ecosystem still in progress, and an M4 dev manager for JSD.
** We have made a hire call on one M5 candidate, but are closing the loop on another before making an offer.
** Although the acceleration is impressive and the blitz will help, we are still well off the revised recruitment commitment, with another 9 Engineering roles to fill in the next month.
* Design - *Looking great*
** We are in the offer process for the top-level designer.
** Sneha and Judd have a strong pipeline of P5 designers, so are tackling Enterprise Support Tooling next.
** If we can make an accepted offer for the EST designer in the next month, we will have met the revised recruitment commitment for Design.
* PM - *Looking great*
** The GPM role has been offered and accepted! 
** A hire call has been made on a Senior PM for JSD.
** As with Design, if we line up another PM candidate in the next month we'll have met the revised recruitment commitment for PM.

* Engineering Recruitment - *Rapidly catching up*
** We are in the offer process for the M5 role, after making a choice between the remaining two candidates, both good Atlassian fits.
** With a push of dedicated effort from Priya, Meenaxi and Subodh, we have 23 confirmed dev candidates for the blitz.
** We are closing in on the revised recruitment commitment, with 6 Engineering roles to fill by the end of the month (down from 9 a week ago). 
** 3 of those 6 are dev roles that may be filled by the blitz, leaving only two TLs and a QE that are unlikely to be filled in what's left of Q2. 
** Although this is off target, the amount of catching-up that the team has achieved, from starting in late August, is impressive. Thank you all!
** Chicho (Marketplace Recruiter) only has one more role to fill in Marketplace, and then she will join in the Server Engineering recruitment effort as well.
* Design/PM - *Looking great*
** The Senior Design Manager (Madhu) has accepted the offer.
* Overall - *On track*
** This is the first status report where we are tracking *On Track* instead of *At Risk*. 
** This was caused by the R&D OKR turning green for the first time, with a projected end-of-year score of 0.7.
** And this was caused by a change in the estimated stage of two teams by the end of the FY - the first JSD team to Owning Features (up from Contributing) and the second JSD team to Contributing (up from Forming).
** And this was caused by unexpected success in triad hiring - which should allow us to get teams more ownership, sooner - and a pattern of hiring showing a very healthy dev pipeline that does not rely on referrals - indicating that we should be able to fill out the rest of the dev teams reasonably quickly. 
** Of course, this assumes that once we have the people, we do all the hard work to make them successful - we don't muck up their onboarding, knowledge transfer, etc. We have a very long way to go!","14/Dec/18 2:46 AM PST;pwyatt;Status report for 14th December 2018:

* Recruitment - *Multiplying*
** We have 7 Server R&D team members on the ground now.
** Additionally we have 11 accepted offers, waiting to start.

** The focus is now on fast-tracking the M3 Dev TL hiring process - 5 candidates are currently in the pipeline.
** Several members of the recruiting team (Sneha, Meenaxi, Sandesh) will be visiting Sydney next week.
* Enterprise Support Tooling - *Cancelled*

** Several of our TAs are visiting Sydney at the moment and have taken the opportunity to spend time with hiring managers.
** Matt Jeffrey has drawn attention to the concern that we have only hired men in Server Engineering and PM thus far:
*** Our ratio of 0% is far below the Atlassian BLR average of 31%, and the industry average of 30%.
*** Manoj and Priya are looking at doing some LinkedIn campaigns in the future to target women in tech.
*** In the meantime, I have requested Priya to run an experiment and spend a week only sourcing women. If this is unsuccessful and delays our hiring for a week, I (Penny) am happy to take full responsibility.

","15/Nov/18 7:03 PM PST;ddomingo;Following the sync-up with [~abrokes] and [~bmeehan] last week, I updated the drafts for Jira and Confluence AND also did the Bitbucket one, as Adam said he'd fixed the templates for that as well. So the way we document it is as follows:

1. Step 1 (optional) is to deploy a VPC using the updated CF template. 
2. Step 2 is to provision your Jira, Confluence, or Bitbucket on that VPC (the CF template for that doesn't change for all three).

Step 1 is optional because we allow users to deploy all of their Atlassian products as separate stacks on the same VPC. So if you've already deployed, say, Jira using Step 1 and Step 2, then when you deploy Confluence you only need to run Step 2.

Next week I'll finish up on the [Bitbucket CAC Quickstart page|https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/getting-started-with-bitbucket-server-and-aws-776640193.html] and review the ones for [Jira|https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~ddomingo/pages/341745178/DRAFT+-+Getting+started+with+Jira+Data+Center+on+AWS] and [Confluence|https://hello.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~ddomingo/pages/341776414/DRAFT+-+Running+Confluence+Data+Center+in+AWS].

Identified 3 work arounds
# Abandon the project
# Name all v2 services differently to their v1 counterparts
# Don't support both versions of the API at the same time.

We decided on 3 as 1 leaves us with developer pain until the next release. 2 gives us ugly v2's in service names that don't make any sense when v1 is gone.

Work for upgrading fugue continues. Deeksha is doing some additional investigation in to why our initial implementation didn't work. With the addition of the 3.16 release it's possible we might still have a staged rollout.
Team is also revisiting decision to upgrade fugue rather than fully replacing it with Exceptions. Upgrade work is still useful in removing the older versions of fugue we just might not expose them to customers

We spiked providing a wrapping util to convert Eithers to Exceptions and based on the results of the spike we decided that the extra effort required to remove fugue entirely was less than originally though and provided a lot more value.

As a result this project has shifted to entirely remove Eithers in favour of Exceptions and Options in favour of Optionals to make the API more consistent with other Atlassian products and java APIs in general.

A few services have already been converted and the announcement has been made https://community.developer.atlassian.com/t/jira-service-desk-is-deprecating-com-atlassian-fugue-in-3-15/22326/4
